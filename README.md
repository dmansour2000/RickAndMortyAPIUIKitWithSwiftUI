 ## Rick and Morty App
 
 ### Description

This native iOS mobile app, built with UIKit and SwiftUI, leverages the Rick and Morty API using Combine to fetch and display information about characters, locations, and episodes from the beloved animated series. As well as that, it includes a few unit tests for the service. It also utilizes the SDWebImage swift library for efficient image loading and caching.
